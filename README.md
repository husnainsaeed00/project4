# Project 4: Social Network - Twitter Clone

This project is a web application that mimics the functionality of a social network platform, similar to Twitter. Users can create accounts, post tweets, follow/unfollow other users, like and comment on tweets, and more.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

- **Backend**: Built using Django, a Python web framework. It handles user authentication, tweet creation and management, following/unfollowing functionality, and API endpoints to retrieve data.

- **Frontend**: Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface. It allows users to navigate the social network, post tweets, view timelines, and interact with other users' tweets.

- **Database**: The application uses a relational database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store user information, tweets, likes, comments, and other relevant data.
